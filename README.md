# Tasks-Manager

LIGHTHALL LEVEL 2 CHALLENGE

Get Organized with a Task Tracker App

For this challenge, you are going to build a task tracker app. Your minimum requirements are:

1) Create a task with a title, description, status (completed, in progress, etc.), and due date

2) Edit and delete Tasks

3) View all tasks, and sort by title, status, and due date

4) Users can log in by entering their name and will only see their tasks. That means, I should be able to enter “Maya”, add tasks for Maya and only see Maya’s tasks when I enter that name, whenever I visit the Task Tracker App
